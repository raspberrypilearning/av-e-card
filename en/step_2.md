## Record your video

You can't add recorded video to Scratch, but you can import GIFs. When you import a GIF as a sprite, Scratch breaks the GIF up, and each frame of the GIF becomes a new costume for the new sprite.

**Remember that the video you are going to create will be public, so make sure you have nothing that could identify your name or location in the shot, and get permission from your parents to create and use the video first.**

To make things a little faster in Scratch, you should optimise the GIF. To do this, select the **Optimize** checkbox. You might also like to reduce the resolution.
